# Find My Team

## Summary
FindMyTeam is a web application that is meant to help iSchool students find groups quickly, but to also provide them with the opportunity to see a quick preview of potential partners so that they may be more well-informed as for how they are choosing their partners. We hope that this provides students with the ability to make the most out of their academic collaborative experiences.
