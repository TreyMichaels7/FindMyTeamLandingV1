# Find My Team

## Summary
FindMyTeam is a web application that is meant to help iSchool students find groups quickly, but to also provide them with the opportunity to see a quick preview of potential partners so that they may be more well-informed as for how they are choosing their partners. We hope that this provides students with the ability to make the most out of their academic collaborative experiences.

## Stakeholders
- Students: our current version of FindMyTeam is meant to focus on supporting iSchool students, especially because it is fairly common for Informatics classes to have some form of major collaborative project. This would also benefit students looking for groups for their capstone project.
- Instructors

## Features
- Ability to search for courses, groups and students
- Make your own user profile and learn more about others based on their user profile
- Get recommended options for student pairings based on your or your group's preferences
- Find other student's contact info to coordinate and communicate quickly
